# ArXiv Paper Chat Application - Implementation Progress

## Core Backend Setup
- [ ] Install required dependencies (pdf-parse, axios)
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for paper and chat data
- [ ] Set up utility functions for arXiv scraping and PDF parsing
- [ ] Implement paper storage system

## API Endpoints
- [ ] Create POST /api/paper/scrape - scrape and store arXiv papers
- [ ] Create GET /api/paper/[id] - retrieve stored paper content
- [ ] Create POST /api/chat - chat with Claude Sonnet 4 using paper context

## Frontend Components
- [ ] Create root layout.tsx with proper styling
- [ ] Create home page with paper URL input form
- [ ] Create shared paper chat page (/paper/[id])
- [ ] Build PaperInput component with URL validation
- [ ] Build ChatInterface component with message history
- [ ] Build PaperInfo component to display paper details
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling

## Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Testing & Deployment
- [x] Install dependencies
